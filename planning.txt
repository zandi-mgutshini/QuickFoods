Create a record to define a Menu Item object.
The menu item object has 2 attributes: meal name (string) and meal price (double).
Create a method for menu item called getMenuItemString() that returns a formatted string with the meal name and meal price.
e.g. "%s R %.2f", where %s = meal name and %.2f = meal price formatted to 2 decimal places.

Create a restaurant class with the following attributes:
i. restaurant name (String);
ii. restaurant location (String);
iii. restaurant phone number (String); and
iv. restaurant menu (Array list of menu items).
Create 2 restaurant constructors. An empty constructor to instantiate a restaurant with no parameters, and a constructor that takes all restaurant attributes as parameters.
Create getters and setters for all restaurant attributes.
Create a method printRestaurantMenu() that has no return type that prints the array list of menu items using the getMenuItemString() method from the MenuItem record.
Create a printRestaurantSummary() method that has no return type (i.e. void)- That prints the restaurant's name, location, number, and menu.

Create a customer class with the following attributes:
i. customer name (string);
ii. customer email (string);
iii. customer phone (string);
iv. customer location (string); and
v. customer address (string).
Create 2 customer object constructors: an empty constructor that sets customer default parameters, and a constructor that accepts all attributes of customer as parameters.
Create getters and setters for each customer attribute.
Create a printCustomerSummary() method with a void return type that prints the customers name, email, phone number, location, and address.

Create a delivery driver class with the following attributes:
i. driver name (String);
ii. driver location (string); and
iii. driver load (int).
Create a driver constructor that takes a string, commaSeparatedNameLocationLoadString as a parameter.
This constructor should split commaSeparatedNameLocationLoadString at each comma "," to create an array of strings.
This new array of strings, nameLocationLoadAray, will have length 3.
The string at index 0 is assigned to driver's name.
The string at index 1 is assigned to this driver's location.
The string at index 2 will be parsed into an integer and assigned to this driver's load.
The constructor described above will be used to create Delivery Drivers in the main method, given the drivers.txt file line by line.
Create getters and setters for all attributes of DeliveryDriver.

Create a class called invoice with the following attributes:
i. invoice number (string);
ii. invoice customer (Customer)
iii. invoice restaurant (Restaurant);
iv. invoice restaurant menu (array list of menu items);
v. invoice items (array of menu items);
vi. invoice quantities (array of integers);
vii. invoice delivery driver (delivery driver); and
viii. invoice special instructions (string).
Create a constructor with no parameters that sets the default values of the invoice item.
Create setters and getters for the attributes of an invoice object.
Create a method getInvoiceTotal() that returns a double called the invoice total.
The method getInvoiceTotal() loops through the invoice items array and the invoice quantities array. The product of the meal price and corresponding quantity is added to invoice total.
Create a method called invoiceItemQuantityPriceString() that returns a string, This method returns a formatted string of quantity meal name and meal price for each menu item in the invoice items array.
Override the toString() method and generate a string that displays all the invoice information i.e.:
